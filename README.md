This is my delivery of the Html and CSS course assignment with the Square Eyes website

In this assignment I have used Visual Studio Code to write my CSS and Html.
I have made a github repository and updated it as I have worked on this assignment and made a netlify and connected so I can see my changes.

I have created the pages as was required from the site architecture of my chose brief: 
Home
List of Videos
A video page showing the product details (product details such as the description of the product, price and add to cart button)
A checkout page
A checkout success
About
Contact

References: I found good help in the Guitar Kings assignment/answer repos that helped me understand how to structure and style the heropage.
