    <p>Welcome to my first website.</p>
    <h2>Web Security</h2>
    <p id="web-security-question">How would you advise a potential client to secure his/her website from web security attacks? Note: the word count for your answer should not be greater than 250 words</p>
    <p id="web-security-answer">In order to secure the application the app should never trust user input, and always properly sanitize input data. Do not work directly with the database, look into using and object related mapping library. This is done in order to reduce the risk of Cross-site scripting, cross-site request forgery and sql injection attacks. [1]<br>
      <br>
      The sanitation can be done by using third party libraries, but one should always be cautious when choosing one, making sure that the library is properly tested, maintained, has the correct license to comply with company policies and that it does not have to many dependencies.[2]<br>
      <br>
      For a secure authorization and authentication implementation consider using an existing, up to date, protocol. As well as keeping in mind that the user should not be presented with verbose error messages, such as if the password was wrong, but the username was correct. Make sure to limit number if retries on login and consider the use of short lived refresh tokens [3]<br>
      <br>
      When it comes to having the app in production, consider using a Continuous Integretion/Continuous Deployment pipeline running security checks and a well written unit tests. [1]<br>
      <br>
      Further it is important to keep updated on new vulnerabilities and zero days and keep an eye on the current threat landscape. Keep third party libraries updated.[4]
